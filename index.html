          What if consciousness is not a byproduct of the brain, but the fundamental substrate of the universe itself?
          Ancient wisdom and modern <strong>Panpsychism</strong> converge on this truth: we do not generate awareness;
          we are immersed in it.
          The universe is not a machine that produces mind, but a mind that manifests a machine.

        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          For millennia, philosophers have contemplated whether mind or matter came first.
          In the West, <strong>Idealism</strong> (from Plato to Berkeley) proposed that reality is fundamentally mental.
          In the East, <strong>Vedanta</strong> teaches that Brahman – pure consciousness – is the ground of all being.
          The Hermetic axiom <em>"As above, so below"</em> suggests a cosmos where consciousness and manifestation are
          reflections of one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          British philosopher <strong>Alfred North Whitehead</strong> founded process philosophy, viewing reality as experience in motion rather than static matter<button data-portal-target="whitehead-portal" aria-label="Learn more about Alfred North Whitehead"></button>.<br>

        <h3>Modern Science</h3>
        <p>
          Today, <strong>Panpsychism</strong> is experiencing a renaissance. Philosophers like Philip Goff and
          neuroscientists like Christof Koch
          propose that consciousness might not "emerge" from complex computation, but instead be intrinsic to the fabric
          of reality itself.
          <strong>Integrated Information Theory (IIT)</strong> by Giulio Tononi suggests that any system with a specific
          type of causal structure possesses some degree of consciousness.

        <p>
          The quantum world defies classical intuition. <strong>Superposition</strong> allows particles to exist in
          multiple states simultaneously until observed.
          <strong>Entanglement</strong> connects particles across vast distances instantaneously. The <strong>Observer
            Effect</strong> suggests that consciousness itself
          may play a role in collapsing the wave function, transforming probability into actuality.

          Rather than generating consciousness, the brain filters an infinite "Mind at Large" down to the narrow stream
          of awareness
          necessary for biological survival. We don't create consciousness; we tune into it, like a radio receiving a
