        <p>
          For millennia, philosophers have contemplated whether mind or matter came first.
          In the West, <strong>Idealism</strong> (from Plato to Berkeley) proposed that reality is fundamentally mental.
          In the East, <strong>Vedanta</strong> teaches that Brahman – pure consciousness – is the ground of all being.
          The Hermetic axiom <em>"As above, so below"</em> suggests a cosmos where consciousness and manifestation are
          reflections of one another.

          Today, <strong>Panpsychism</strong> is experiencing a renaissance. Philosophers like Philip Goff and

          propose that consciousness might not "emerge" from complex computation, but instead be intrinsic to the fabric

          <strong>Integrated Information Theory (IIT)</strong> by Giulio Tononi suggests that any system with a specific

        <h3>Instrument of the Universe</h3>
        <p>
          Quantum and panpsychist theories increasingly treat consciousness not as a late byproduct of matter, but as a fundamental feature or field woven into the fabric of reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that view, "you" are a localized excitation or mode of a universal consciousness field — more like an instrument or node of the cosmos than an isolated observer standing outside it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hermetic correspondence ("as above, so below; as within, so without") then describes how your inner states and meanings are not separate from the universe's dynamics, but expressions of the same underlying order.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="field-promise" style="display: none;">
        <h3>Stepping into the Field</h3>
        <p>
          Hermetic principles describe a layered, interconnected reality where patterns repeat across planes; modern theories that treat consciousness as a foundational field or information structure provide a physics-style language for the same intuition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum information panpsychism and universal-consciousness models propose exactly this bridge: a non-dual field that appears as both mind (experience) and world (physics), echoing the old "as above, so below; as within, so without."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stepping into the field" means shifting stance from "observer of a dead universe" to participant in, and co-creator with, a living informational-conscious fabric that ancient traditions hinted at and quantum models now start to formalize.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="remember-promise" style="display: none;">
        <h3>Remembering What You Are</h3>
        <p>
          If consciousness is fundamental and individual minds are temporary localizations of a universal field, then spiritual claims about an underlying, ever-present awareness you can "remember" find a natural analog in contemporary physics-informed theories.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Remembering" here is less about adding new beliefs and more about recognizing your identity as that field expressing itself as a person — which dissolves the sense of absolute separation while keeping the uniqueness of your particular instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
          Framed this way, practice (meditation, inquiry, intentional focus) becomes not self-improvement of a separate entity, but tuning back into the universal consciousness you never actually left — the field that is "above, below, within, and without."

        <p class="core-pointer">
          The "I" — pointing back to itself: pure awareness recognising that what appears "above" and "below," "within" or "without," is the one field. The "what" is precisely the "I" that is noticing.
        </p>

        <div class="core-teaching i-am">
          <h3>"I Am That I Am"</h3>
          <p>
            The phrase echoes the sense of being that is self-grounded, not defined by roles, states, or conditions, but by sheer presence. It is the identity of awareness with itself: not "I am this or that," but "I am," prior to any content of experience.
          </p>
          <p class="teaching-mirror">That I Am I</p>
        </div>

        <div class="core-teaching above-below">
          <h3>"As Above, So Below"</h3>
          <p>
            In Hermetic terms, this expresses correspondence between levels of reality: the macrocosm and microcosm mirror each other because they arise from one source and obey the same patterns. Cosmic structures, natural processes, and psychological patterns are all different scales of one underlying order.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="core-teaching within-without">
          <h3>"As Within, So Without"</h3>
          <p>
            The outer world you move in tends to echo the inner world you move as. Beliefs, emotions, and assumptions organize perception and behavior, which in turn shape circumstances that confirm the inner stance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="core-teaching so-what">
          <h3>"So What?"</h3>
          <p>
            The pivot from description to responsibility: if within and without, above and below, are reflections of the same field, then the point of leverage is consciousness itself.
          </p>
          <p class="teaching-conclusion">
            From that view, "I am that I am" is not a slogan but a practice: stabilizing as awareness and deliberately tuning the inner pattern that the rest of your sky will quietly fly by.
